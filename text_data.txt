The usage of keywords/acronyms can be very dangerous if used incorrectly in people's lives. The other day I was working on RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption to make a secure database using the GitHub API, I was trying to encrypt private user information in a public GitHub repository such that user information would be unread able and thus safe. I also learned that RSA has a lot of other ancroynms, including the name of social services (Revenu de Solidarie Active), Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion, Rehabilitation Services Administration, and much more. The world is becoming more and more connected with AI, imagine if AI did not make the Transformer and more complicated algorithms to correctly identify people's data with respect to a context, people would be falsely identified with many incorrect activities that would diminish/improve one's life. I think using acronmys hide truth and justice of real-life affairs, and I perfer to only use the long full names instead of acronyms. For years, in an attempt to improve my memory I started reading and trying to memorize the full names of acronyms, and not use acronyms. I was not consciously aware of the impact of not using acronyms on my life, but I think my life is clearer, I have a better memory of what the words mean, and I feel more intelligent because I can say the real word instead of some letters. Using acronyms is a cruch and makes one less good at speaking, writing, and understanding, just like shortening real words in chat/text messaging.
