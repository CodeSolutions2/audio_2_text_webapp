# audio_2_text_webapp

Being active in life means that one is taking action, and learning by reflecting on the responses in their life due to their activity. By recording or writing ideas in a journal, self-discovery and better decision making can be fostered to have a "Happy and Healthy Life". The purpose of this webapp is to create a chat-bot journal, compiling both audio and text, such that better self-awareness and responsibility can be acheived. 

Chat-bot technology used self-transformative manner can be the start of a new type of self-therapy that perhaps could be used to help people to:
1. better solve their problems,
2. be less violent with themselves and others,
3. have more self-respect and respect for others,
4. be more responsible such that everyone can have a positive future,
5. and live a happier and healthier life.
